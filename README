Project "Rolls"
===============

This is the second project for the "Introduction to Computer Graphics" module.

Mission statement:
Create an advertisment for Rolls Royce Motor Cars

version control: git
build system:    waf
issue tracking:  trac

Notes on compiling
==================

PREQUISITES:
- MinGW g++
- freeglut binaries and headers for MinGW
- waf
- boost headers
- libboost_regex_gcc-1_45.a

This project uses waf as a build system. waf is simply a Python script, included
with this distribution. To build the project, change to the folder containing the waf
file, and run the following commands:
> python waf configure
> python waf
Then the building process should start. 

Since 0.4, the application needs boost. The path to boost is hard-coded
in wscript and should be changed accordingly.

Since 0.4.1, the libboost_regex_gcc-1_45.a library is used, so lib paths
were adjusted in wscript. 
IMPORTANT: the boost distribution does not include binaries, so libboost_regex_gcc-1_45.a
must be compiled and placed in a folder which is searched by the compiler for lib files.
