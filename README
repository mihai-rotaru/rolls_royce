Project "Rolls"
===============

This is the second project for the "Introduction to Computer Graphics" module.

Mission statement:
Create an advertisment for Rolls Royce Motor Cars

version control: git
build system:    waf
issue tracking:  trac

Notes on compiling
==================
Since 0.4, the application needs boost. The path to boost is hard-coded
in wscript and should be changed accordingly.

Since 0.4.1, the libboost_regex_gcc-1_45.a library is used, so lib paths
were adjusted in wscript.
