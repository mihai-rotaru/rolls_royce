Includes
========
- if 3 or more headers are included, and at least 2 belong to the same group,
they will be 'grouped' - a blank line is left between the two and the rest.
- headers are included in the following order: from general to specific
- groups:
    ( the general-to-specific order applies inside groups as well )
    - std ( iostream, list, string, etc )
    - OpenGL ( glu, etc ) + freeglut ( glut.h, etc )
    - boost
    - project's files ( Line, etc )
- if all headers are unrelated, they won't be separated by blank lines
- the xmx namespace statements have a blank line between them and other content    
- the curly bracket opening the xmx namespace is on the same line as the
namespace xmx statement
- the curly bracket closing the xmx namespace is followed by // namespace xmx

Classes
=======
Methods/variables are declared in the following order:
- ctors/dtors
- member variables:
- if class is a container-type class, a line is left blank between the
containers and the other member variables
- other member variables
- methods implementing a virtual class
- other methods 
- methods are implemented in the same order they are declared

Other
=====
- method parameters denoting coordinates are named x_coord, y_coord, z_coord
- method parameters denoting angles are named theta
- points are named using single capital letters ( P, A, B ), or P0, P1
