- use waf to compile the multi-file project
- ensure rotation does not suffer from 'gravitation' ( as in cg_project_1 )
- make sure objects are not clipped when moving outside visible area ( as in cg_project_2 )
- implement morphing

- color tools - classes to handle making a color lighter, saturation, etc
- BezierPath: aggreate of BezierCurve
- BezierPath has a method for parsing .pov files
? BezierShape: aggregate of BezierPath's
- implement static FPS
- investigate boost regex'es
- read from .pov files into BezierPath

C++
- use smart pointers
- use C++ exceptions
- use wide strings
- use floats instead of ints

Infrastructure
- use trac
- waf option to statically link freeglut and libstdc++
- waf option to optimize the build
